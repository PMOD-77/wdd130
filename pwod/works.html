            Place Holder: In The Echoes of Hollow Pines, a small, isolated town hides a chilling secret—one that has kept its residents trapped in an endless cycle of fear and silence. When investigative journalist Lila Mercer arrives in Hollow Pines to report on a string of mysterious disappearances, she quickly realizes that the town's past is woven with eerie folklore and sinister rituals. The deeper she digs, the more she is haunted by whispers in the woods, cryptic warnings from frightened locals, and a presence that seems to be watching her every move. As the boundary between reality and nightmare blurs, Lila must unravel the town’s dark history before she becomes its next victim. But in Hollow Pines, some secrets are never meant to be unearthed.

            Place Holder: In The Clockmaker’s Gambit, Elias Vance thought he had escaped the chaos of time’s unraveling—but time hasn’t finished with him yet. When a strange anomaly begins distorting reality, pulling objects and people from lost eras into the present, Elias is forced to once again seek answers within the mysterious pocket watch that started it all. But this time, he’s not the only one searching. A secret society known as the Order of the Pendulum believes the watch holds the key to controlling time itself, and they will stop at nothing to claim it. As Elias is thrust into a dangerous game of cat and mouse across shifting timelines, he discovers an even more terrifying truth—time isn’t breaking; it’s being rewritten. And unless he stops the Order, history itself may be erased forever.

            Place Holder: In The Clockmaker’s End, time itself is collapsing, and Elias Vance is the only one who can stop it. The pocket watch—once a key to unraveling the mysteries of time—has become an instrument of destruction, its power now unstable and threatening to erase entire timelines. The Order of the Pendulum has harnessed its energy, seeking to reshape history in their own image, and the past, present, and future are beginning to fracture beyond repair. With reality breaking apart around him, Elias must embark on one final journey through the labyrinth of time, uncovering the watch’s true origins and the ancient force that has been manipulating history all along. But saving time will require the ultimate sacrifice, and Elias must decide: will he destroy the watch and restore order, or wield its power one last time—at the risk of being lost to eternity? In this final chapter, the clock strikes its last hour, and time’s reckoning begins.
